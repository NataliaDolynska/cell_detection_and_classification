#  Pipeline for detection of AgNORs from histopathology images

### Overview
This repository contains a pipeline for processing images of cells, detecting and classifying them, and calculating an AgNOR (Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organizer Region) score based on the cell labels. The pipeline includes object detection, cell classification, and error evaluation based on annotation files.

###  Results
The pipeline successfully processes cell images, detects cells, classifies them, and computes AgNOR scores. The errors between predicted and actual scores are calculated, which can be used to evaluate the model's performance.
